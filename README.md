# hackathontools
A tailor made java libraries ready to use for any hackathon competition. The function implemented should be working genericly.  Having generic input (or without input),  and return generic output that can be useful for the developer. The library focus on generic data manipulation (such as feeding by open data),  date manipulation, standard GUI utility can be use any time, Java image manipulation,  etc.   By the time,  the list can be added.

The inspiration for this projects comes after participating in my very first hackathon in May 2018.   
The purpose of this project is just create a java library that can help in a limited time coding competition using Java language. 
The library should help developer to process data quickly on general type of hackathon. For some ideas, in open-data hackathon, the app should be able to parse the open data provided. 

The tools should have a proper javadoc documentation, so everybody could make use of it. 

Some ideas to be added on the library:
1.  Date Manipulation.
2.  Generic Parser that read an input (and its delimiter type), and return the words. 
3.  String manipulation.  (example to combine two data, etc). 
4.  GUI Utilities.  ex:  Generic JPanel for Java GUI.  etc..
5. others to be added..
